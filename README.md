<Github_Notes
 - You can merge your work onto the  MASTER branch by either
    - Making your own folder calling it Marcus or whatever you want
    - I will have my own Folder
    Why? --> This is done to simulate the feature of Github known as branches. You don't know how to use branches yet so this is my solution to it that I've used with other people before. Eventually you will learn to create branches and delete them once you push your changes to the master branch.

    - How do I "update" or PUSH my code to github?\
    1. Git pull 
        - You always want to pull from the master branch to see what is the latest code before writing your own code that might conflict with other code that is already published on the branches.
        - Since we are going to have our own folders this is going to be avoided, unless you go into my folder and mess with my files and code then it will mess up but Github is sophisticated enough to let you know what your code will overwrite and will give you the option to overwrite or delete your changes.
    2. Git add .
    3. Git commit -m "ENTER YOUR OWN COMMENT OR DESCRIPTION OF THE CODE YOUR PUSHING"
        - Yes you have to put quotations in that exact format with the -m and space
    4. Git push


    - Once you feel comfortable with pushing code and want to make your own repo to practice Github code updating you should look up 
        - Creating branches for features 
        - Pushing and merging code to master branch
        - Delete branch once it has approved etc.
